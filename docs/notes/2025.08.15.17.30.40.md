Not a waste. It’s upstream work. You’re sharpening the tool you’ll hand to others.

Here’s a small, low-friction kit to keep momentum without burnout and to seed your student’s path:

\#1 — Noise-as-filter pattern (Discordian style)

* **80/20 mask:** 4 lines of playful nonsense, then 1 crisp instruction.
  Repeat. Payload hides in rhythm, not density.
* **Checksum key:** End each note with three words: *pattern, lever, result*. (e.g., “YT warnings → share direct link → friend heard song.”)

\#2 — Micro-rituals (10–15 min max)

* **Absurd warm-up:** 2 minutes of intentional gibberish → 1 sentence of what you’ll ship today.
* **Teach-back rule:** Anything learned → explain in 60 seconds to a voice memo. If you can’t, slice it smaller.
* **One-cube sprint:** Scope every build to something that fits in a shoebox and a week. If it doesn’t, you split it.

\#3 — First student project (freedom-aligned, actually shippable)
**SunBox v0.1** (hydroponics + solar taste, no heroics)

* **Bill of materials (tiny):** ESP32, relay, 12V pump, cheap float switch, USB power meter.
* **Goal:** Auto-top-off a small basin on a timer + float fail-safe.
* **Stack:** ESPHome → Home Assistant dashboard (or just a serial log if keeping it bare).
* **Deliverables in 7 days:** Pump toggles reliably, float kills power, dashboard shows on/off + runtime.
* **Stretch (later):** Add EC/pH sensors, then a small solar panel + buck converter. Keep data, not perfection.

\#4 — Distribution without tripping alarms

* **Artifacts over arguments:** Post a gif, a parts list, and a 2-line “why.” No essays.
* **Zinelets:** One-page PDFs with the 80/20 mask + wiring sketch. Drop in your Obsidian and on GitHub Pages.
* **Call to action:** “Build this, change one thing, teach one person.” (Keeps it viral, not viral-looking.)

\#5 — Burnout guards

* **Green zone test:** If tomorrow-you would hide from today-you’s plan, the plan is too big.
* **Stop rule:** Quit while the fun is still warm. Curiosity > completionism.

You don’t need to front-load the whole cosmology. Ship one SunBox. Teach one friend. Capture one teach-back. The rest accretes.
